                    <p>
                        For the last 7 years, I used to work as a chef. I had succeeded in this are but unfortunately, I was injured at work and had to face a new reality as a disabled person. I am not able to work as a chef anymore, but I think it's a good opportunity for a new start in my life. That's why I decided to learn software engineering and I love it! First I started to learn JavaScript on my own, then I took online courses. I am constantly facing new challenges and right now I am learning React and I think I am succeeding in it. In my free time, I create small hands-on projects which you can check on my GitHub. If you are interested in my candidacy please fill free to contact me with any way you want.
